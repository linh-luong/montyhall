\title{Simulate multiple Monty Hall games.}
\usage{
play_n_games(n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{n:}{Integer. The number of games to simulate (default = 100).}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns for all simulated games:
\itemize{
\item strategy: character string ("stay" or "switch")
\item outcome: character string ("WIN" or "LOSE")
}

A summary table of win/loss proportions by strategy is also printed
to the console.
}
\description{
play_n_games() runs repeated simulations of the Monty Hall problem
using both strategies (stay or switch) and summarizes the outcomes.
}
\details{
The function automates the process of playing the game multiple times.
For each trial, it calls play_game() to simulate one full game.
Results are collected in a list, combined into a single data frame,
and then summarized in a contingency table showing the proportion
of wins and losses for each strategy.
}
\examples{
Run 10 games
results <- play_n_games(10)
}
